# CDS OpenAPI
This is the OpenAPI schema for [CDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/curb-data-specification) (Curb Data Specification) data feeds, managed by the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation). 

A browseable schema is available on [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/) at [https://openmobilityfnd.stoplight.io/docs/cds-openapi](https://openmobilityfnd.stoplight.io/docs/cds-openapi).

The CDS schema versions are organized by repo branches. For example, the latest **v1.0.0-dev** is on the [v1.0.0-dev branch](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/cds-openapi/tree/v1.0.0-dev).

Within each branch, there is a single YAML file that defines each CDS API (curbs, events, metrics). 

# CDS v1.0.0 Rebuild Branch
This branch is a WIP to refactor theh v1.0 of the CDS Open API Spec so that there is a separate YAML file for each of the CDS endpoints.
