title: Curb Policy
x-stoplight:
  id: z8z47h6duwmg8
type: object
description: |-
  A Policy object is a rule that allows or prohibits a particular set of users from using a particular curb at a particular time or times. Multiple Policy objects together define the full extent of regulations within a Curb Zone.

  The design of the Policy object borrows heavily from the work of the CurbLR project, with additions for the larger scope of CDS.
properties:
  curb_policy_id:
    description: |-
      An ID that uniquely identifies this exact regulation across Curb Zones. Two Policy objects containing the same `curb_policy_id` MUST be completely identical.

      A `curb_policy_id` MUST NOT be reused. Once created, it must continue to refer to the identical policy forever.
    type: string
  published_date:
    $ref: ./timestamp.yaml
    description: |-
      The date/time that this policy was first published in this data feed.

      An integer representing a number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1st, 1970 UTC (the UNIX epoch)
  priority:
    type: integer
    description: 'Specifies which other policies this one takes precedence over. If two Policies on the same Curb Zone have overlapping Time Spans and apply to the same user class, the one that applies at a given time is the one with the lowest priority.'
  rules:
    type: array
    description: The rule(s) that this policy applies.
    items:
      $ref: ./rules.yaml
      description: 'A rule defines who is allowed to do what, and for how long, on a curb, per the policy.'
  time_spans:
    type: array
    description: 'If specified, this regulation only applies at the times defined within.'
    items:
      $ref: ./time_spans.yaml
      description: 'A time span defines a period of time (that may occur once or repeatedly) during which a given regulation applies. When multiple fields are combined, all criteria must be met in order for a given Time Span to apply.'
  data_source_operator_id:
    type: array
    description: |-
      An array of Data Source Operator IDs that this policy only applies to.

      **Values are defined globally and are managed by the Open Mobility Foundation and operators may register [here](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/curb-data-specification/wiki/Adding-a-CDS-Data-Source-Operator-ID)**
