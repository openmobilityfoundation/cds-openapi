description: |-
  A Policy object is a rule that allows or prohibits a particular set of users from using a particular curb at a particular time or times. Multiple Policy objects together define the full extent of regulations within a Curb Zone.

  The design of the Policy object borrows heavily from the work of the CurbLR project, with additions for the larger scope of CDS.
