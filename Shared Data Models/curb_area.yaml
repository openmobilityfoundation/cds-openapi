title: Curb Area
description: |-
  Defines curb areas in a city and their properties. A Curb Area is a particular neighborhood or area of interest that includes one or more Curb Zones. Important notes about Curb Areas:

  * Curb Areas MAY overlap with other Curb Areas
  * Multiple Curb Areas MAY include the same Curb Zones
  * Curb Areas are not meant to be city-wide, and instead should be an area of interest around one or more Curb Zones that is no bigger than a neighborhood.
  * Unlike Zones, Areas may be updated as needed, with a new curb_area_id being optionally assigned by the city.
